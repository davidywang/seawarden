## Sea Warden
### Goal
Our goal is to provide independent oversight of global marine aquaculture activty.

### Method
We combine observations from several earth observation sattelites and object detection algorithms to locate finfish farming sites.

### Next Steps
We are currently in the "mapping" phase where we are locating farming sites, and our next step will be to increase our observation cycles to provide monitoring capability.
